We need to expand on these greatly, I don't really know how to fluff it up to two pages though. I'll be working on it but it needs to be done soon...
The goal is to search for an image with the image. If I have a copy of the image I want to find other places online that the image has been used.

We care because we want to be able to find things we are interested in without having to come up with descriptors, a picture is worth a thousand words.

Michael do the part about approach, you said you understood how.

Datasets? I have no idea where to find these, google-fu failed for me

The expected outcome is that the input will be an image and it will return a website where the image was used.
